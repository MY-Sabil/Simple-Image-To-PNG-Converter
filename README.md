## Installation and Usage
Just install the requirements.txt file using 
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Then just run the main.py file, import images and easily convert them to png.

### A cool trick
If you want to quickly run the python file without navigating to the directory again and again, you can easily do that by using a simple cmd file. Just create a new text document and paste the following code:
```
cd <path to directory>
python main.py
```
then save it as a .cmd file. Now you can easily open the converter by just running a cmd file.
